# Monty Hall Web Game

Tech stack: Typescript, React with Next.js, Tailwind, Vitest
State management is managed by local components state and props passing, due to the simple project architecture.
Unit tests are written with Vitest and React testing library.
Accessibility is ensured by use of ARIA markup and enabling keyboard events (Enter and Space) to open the doors.
